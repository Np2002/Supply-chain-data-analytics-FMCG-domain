# Supply Chain Data Analytics – FMCG Domain

• Built a Power BI dashboard covering key KPIs — On-Time Delivery (OT%), In-Full Delivery (IF%), and On-Time In-Full (OTIF%) —  
  to track service levels at AtliQ Mart, an FMCG manufacturer. The dashboard helped identify and address delivery issues  
  with key customers prior to business expansion.

• This analysis has the potential to save up to 20% of the investment planned for expansion.

#  AtliQ Mart Supply Chain Analysis

This project was created as part of the [**October Codebasics Resume Challenge**](https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge/5), where I conducted a detailed supply chain analysis  
and designed an interactive dashboard using Power BI.

##  Project Overview

This project was part of the Codebasics Resume Challenge and also served as a personal learning initiative to enhance my Power BI skills.  
The case study features AtliQ Mart, a fictional FMCG company facing delivery performance issues impacting customer satisfaction.

As a data analyst, I tracked and analyzed supply chain KPIs — OT%, IF%, and OTIF% — and built an interactive Power BI dashboard.  
The project highlights my ability to transform business problems into actionable data insights using industry tools.

##  Problem Statement

AtliQ Mart, a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India, operates in Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara.  
They aim to expand to other metro/tier-1 cities within two years. However, poor delivery service has led to lost customer contracts.  
Management suspects incomplete or delayed deliveries are the root cause and wants to monitor delivery metrics to fix the issue proactively.

---

##  Objective

To address these issues, the Supply Chain Analytics Team aims to monitor:

- **On-Time Delivery (OT%)**
- **In-Full Delivery (IF%)**
- **On-Time In-Full Delivery (OTIF%)**

These metrics will be tracked daily and benchmarked against customer-specific target service levels.

##  Role & Tasks

As a new data analyst (Peter Pandey), I was responsible for:

- Creating key metrics: OT%, IF%, and OTIF%
- Building a Power BI dashboard based on stakeholder requirements (shared via a comic-style transcript)
- Deriving additional insights to aid decision-making

---

##  Data Model

A simplified data model was created linking order, customer, and product-level details to delivery metrics through relationships  
that enable efficient filtering and analysis in Power BI.

##  Dashboard

The dashboard presents a clear overview of service levels across customers, products, and time.  
It enables stakeholders to quickly identify problem areas and take corrective action.

##  Key Insights

- All major delivery KPIs (OT%, IF%, OTIF%) are below targets.
- Average delivery delay is 0.42 days.
- Lotus Mart, Coolblue, and Acclaimed Stores have the highest order volumes and worst delivery performance.
- Ghee, curd, and butter are the most frequently delayed products.
- Performance has not improved in recent months.
- Large gaps in IF% suggest possible production constraints or forecasting errors.
